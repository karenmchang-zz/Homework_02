\f0\fs24 \cf0 Second homework assignment!\
This assignment is to further our practice with OpenSCAD and 3D printing. \
I decided to replicate a real world object, a bottle cap - which turned out to be very delicate. The first print was very precise but broke, the second print was less precise but a little stronger. }
